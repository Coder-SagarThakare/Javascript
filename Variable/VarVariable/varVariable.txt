// Initial value of the variable. It can be any legal expression. Default value is undefined.

Duplicate variable declarations using var will not trigger an error, even in strict mode, and the variable will not lose its value, unless another assignment is performed.
	Variables declared using var are created before any code is executed in a process known as hoisting. Their initial value is undefined.

	The corresponding name is also added to a list on the internal [[VarNames]] slot on the global environment record (which forms part of the global lexical environment). The list of names in [[VarNames]] enables the runtime to distinguish between global variables and straightforward properties on the global object.

	It's important to point out that only a variable's declaration is hoisted, not its initialization. The initialization happens only when the assignment statement is reached. Until then the variable remains undefined.












// according to me we cannot delete normal var/let vaiable using delete operator.
// we can delete any object property using delete like user.name
